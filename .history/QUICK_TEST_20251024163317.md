# Quick Testing Guide

## Check if models are displaying

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Navigate to http://localhost:4323/products
3. Look for these console messages:

```
Products page script loaded
Found X product image containers
Container 0: Loading model from /speaker.glb
Container 0: Size 250x200, aspect ratio 1.25
Container 0: Renderer created and added to DOM
Container 0: Starting to load model...
Container 0: Loading progress: XX%
Container 0: Model loaded successfully!
Container 0: Model added to scene, starting animation
```

## If models are NOT showing:

### Check 1: Are the containers found?
Look for: `Found X product image containers`
- If X = 0, the HTML isn't rendering correctly
- If X > 0, containers exist

### Check 2: Are models loading?
Look for: `Starting to load model...`
- If you don't see this, the loader isn't initializing

### Check 3: Are there errors?
Look for red error messages:
- `404` errors mean the GLB file doesn't exist
- `CORS` errors mean the file can't be loaded
- `THREE` errors mean the 3D library isn't loading

### Check 4: Is the canvas being added?
Look for: `Renderer created and added to DOM`
- If you see this, a canvas should appear in each product card

## Manual Browser Console Tests

Open console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Check if containers exist
document.querySelectorAll('.product-image').length

// Check if any have data-model attribute
document.querySelector('.product-image').getAttribute('data-model')

// Check if canvas was added
document.querySelectorAll('.product-image canvas').length

// Check if THREE.js loaded
typeof THREE
```

## Expected Results

### Products Page
- Should show 2 products (top and sub from speakers.json)
- Each should have a rotating 3D model
- Models should have green edges on grey fill

### Speaker Detail Page
- Click on a product
- Should navigate to /speaker-detail?model=/speaker.glb (or /sub.glb)
- Should show rotating model in top third of screen
- Should show specs in bottom two-thirds

## Common Issues

### Issue: Blank boxes where models should be
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution**: CDN might be blocked. Check network tab in dev tools.

### Issue: Models load but don't rotate
**Solution**: Animation loop might not be running. Check for JavaScript errors.

### Issue: Wrong model loads
**Solution**: Check that data-model attribute matches the speakerTypes.modelPath in speakers.json
