        <p class="font-roboto text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-8 break-inside-avoid mt-12">Horner Audio is a Berlin-based acoustic engineering studio whose passion lies in crafting exceptional sonic experiences for the spaces where people gather. From live-sound installations and PA rentals to custom system design and consulting, our mission is to deliver the highest-fidelity audio solutions that are tailored to each unique environment.</p>
        
        <p class="font-roboto text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-8 break-inside-avoid">At the heart of what we do is the belief that sound isn't just heard — it's felt. We collaborate with venue owners, event-organisers, artists and sound-designers to build systems that don't just reproduce audio, but shape atmosphere, enhance engagement and elevate performance. Whether we're engineering a horn-loaded speaker design or fine-tuning acoustics for a club-space, our focus remains on clarity, presence and the immersive power of well-executed sound.</p>
